            <div class="recommendations-left">
                <p><i>Emma is one of the most authentically creative and passionate graphic designers I know! She strives to understand the essence of the project she's working on, and asks thoughtful questions to get at the heart of creative problem solving. Her designs are smart, clean and clear, which as a strategist is exactly what I want to present to my clients. I also have to note that Emma's energy is one of my favorite things about working with her, and what I'll miss most. Any team would be lucky to have her!</i>

                <p><i>Emma is a true joy to work with. She has a gifted eye for design as well as keen strategic instincts and a gift for problem solving. A true student of the craft she is always pushing herself and is a kind and generous partner to her clients and teammates alike. I look forward to the day where our paths cross again!</i>

                <p><i>Emma is a talented designer and strategic thinker. She has a positive attitude and brings energy and fun to everything she does. I was lucky to have worked with her for three years at Children's Colorado. As a writer, one of the many things I appreciate about Emma is her ability to understand how design must help copy shine, not compete with it or undermine it. She did just that: On projects we worked on together, I always felt like her designs made my copy even better, and she understood the flow of copy on a page. It was clear she read every piece of copy she designed for, and that made it easy to collaborate with her. Emma is always open to feedback and has excellent ideas. Internal clients love working with her because of her caring attitude and ability to listen to their wants and needs. Because of this, she always impressed them with the logos, text treatments, poster designs, templates and other designs she came up with.</i>
